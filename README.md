A list of resources and tools for cleaning, analyzing and visualizing data. All are free except noted otherwise with ($/â‚¹)

## Data conversion
* [Mr. Data Converter](https://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/) converts tab-delimited data/.CSVs to JSON, HTML, Python and more
* [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) extracts data from .PDFs and turns them into .CSVs

## Data cleaning
* [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) helps clean and transform messy data; works especially well for clustering data by similarity to help fix typos

## Data analysis
* If you're comfortable with Excel/Google Sheets, consider [learning R](https://learn.r-journalism.com/en/) or [Python](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-1-python-basics?ex=1)

## Data visualization
